# sharkos-josm-dining-presets
A simple pack of dining presets for the JOSM OpenStreetMap editor.

Languages available: English, French.

## Installation
Copy the ZIP file anywhere on your computer; you can also leave it in your default Downloads folder.
You can unzip it, but then you'll have to select the main XML file itself rather than the entire folder.

Afterwards...
* Go to Edit > Preferences, then to "Tagging Presets"
* On the right box, click the + sign in the top right corner
* Browse to the ZIP file (or the XML file)
* Press OK (no need to add a description), then OK on the Preferences window
* Restart JOSM

## Usage
* Press F3 to view presets
* Type "Dining"
* Select the appropriate preset, then fill in the info
